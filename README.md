### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

2019: Thanks to Sam Potter for comments that helped me speed up the view factor calculations  

Mar 2016: Thanks to Lior Rubanenko for a bug report in cratersQ_*

2010, 2005: Thanks to Oded Aharonson for improvements on mars_mapi2p and a better treatment of the frost/no-frost surface boundary condition.

2006: Troy Hudson discovered a grid-point offset in conductionT and conductionQ, which has been corrected.

2005: Thanks to Mischa Kreslavsky for providing formulas for energy balance on a planar slope.

Many Thanks to Andy Vaught for developing an open-source Fortran 95 compiler (www.g95.org).  The early versions of this code were developed with this compiler.

2001: Samar Khatiwala invented an elegant implementation of the upper radiation boundary condition for the Crank-Nicolson method.

SUPPORT: This code development was supported mainly by NASA, and in smaller parts by Caltech and the University of Hawaii. Undoubtedly, some parts were written in my spare time.
