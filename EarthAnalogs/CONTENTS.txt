Irradiance models for terrestrial analogs
=========================================

sunpos.f90:
	position of the Sun from location on Earth

mk_atmosphere.f90:
	subroutine for 0D atmosphere above Mauna Kea

insol3d_earth.f90: (main program)
	short-wavelength irradiance with topography (terrain shadowing)

insol_flat.f90: (main program)
	short-wavelength solar irradiance at flat location on Earth;
	analogous to insol3d_earth.f90

(several symoblic links to subroutines in Topo3D/)

makefile:
	shows file dependencies
