Asteroids/

Basic Thermal Model for Asteroid Surfaces
=========================================

asteroid_thermal.f90: (main program)

oneasteroid_thermal1d.f90:
	1D diffusion of temperature for airless body

insolonly.f90:
	Insolation only, very simple


Asynchronously Coupled Model of Ice Loss, Temperature, and Impact Stirring on Asteroids
=======================================================================================

asteroid_fast2.f90: (main program)
	Asynchronously coupled model of ice loss, temperature, and
	impact stirring on asteroids

asteroid_fast1.f90: (main program)
	Asynchronously coupled model of ice loss and temperature 
	on asteroids; mostly a simplified version of asteroid_fast2

impactstirring.f90:
	Model of ice homogenization due to impact stirring,
	for use with "fast" model

fast_modules_asteroid.f90:
	modules for asteroid_fast1 and asteroid_fast2
	body-specific parameters are specified in module 'body'

fast_subs_asteroid2.f90:
	subroutines and functions for asteroid_fast2 

fast_subs_asteroid1.f90:
	subroutines and functions for asteroid_fast1

common_subs.f90:
	functions used by many of these programs

sphere1d_implicit.f90: (main program)
	semi-implicit solver for 1D spherically symmetric heat equation and ice retreat

orbit_A0000240.dat:
	sample input for sphere1_implicit

test_gardening1.f90

test_timejumps.f90
