Exosphere/

Monte-Carlo Model for Surface-bounded Exosphere
===============================================

moon_exo.f90: (main program)
	event driven Monte Carlo model for ballistic hops of 
	water molecules on the lunar surface

ceres_exo.f90: (main program)
	event driven Monte Carlo model for ballistic hops of 
	water molecules on the Cerean surface;
	can be used for other airless bodies as well

body.f90:
	body specific input parameters

montecarlo.f90:
	ballistic hops, event scheduler

geogrid.f90:
	everything specific to the geographic grid

geogrid_D.f90:
	a different geographic grid

body.f90:
	module with body specific parameters

subl_subs.f90:
	parametrizations of sublimation rates

gasdev.for: 
	generates Gaussian distribution, from Numerical Recipes (C), changed real to real*8

makefile:
	shows file dependencies
